# Nashville Housing Data Cleaning using SQL

Welcome to the Nashville Housing Data Cleaning repository! This repository focuses on cleaning and preparing Nashville housing data using SQL. By leveraging SQL queries, we aim to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize data formats to ensure data quality for accurate analysis.

## Features

- **Data Import**: Import the Nashville housing dataset into a SQL database for cleaning. Ensure proper database configuration and data integrity.

- **Data Cleaning**: Cleanse the data using SQL queries to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize data formats. Ensure consistency and data quality.

- **Data Transformation**: Transform the data using SQL to normalize or denormalize tables, derive new variables, or perform other necessary data transformations.

- **Data Validation**: Validate the cleaned data by performing integrity checks, ensuring referential integrity, and resolving any inconsistencies.

- **Data Quality Assurance**: Ensure data quality by performing quality checks, validating data against predefined rules or constraints, and correcting any issues.

- **Data Export**: Export the cleaned dataset to a new SQL table or save it as a cleaned dataset for further analysis.

## Usage

1. **Data Import**: Import the Nashville housing dataset into your SQL database. Ensure proper database configuration and data integrity.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleanse the data using SQL queries. Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize data formats. Ensure data quality for accurate analysis.

3. **Data Transformation**: Transform the data using SQL queries as needed. Normalize or denormalize tables, derive new variables, or perform other necessary transformations.

4. **Data Validation**: Validate the cleaned data by performing integrity checks, ensuring referential integrity, and resolving any inconsistencies.

5. **Data Quality Assurance**: Perform quality checks on the cleaned data. Validate data against predefined rules or constraints, and correct any issues that arise.

6. **Data Export**: Export the cleaned dataset to a new SQL table or save it as a cleaned dataset for further analysis.
